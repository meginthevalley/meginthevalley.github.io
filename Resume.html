								After being taught this equipment, it was Megans' responsibility to teach students who weren't interns how to use the equipment when they visited the Makerspace. 
								It was also important that each intern be motivated to find solutions to fix these pieces of equipment if they needed repair. In order to do this, Megan and her fellow

						Recently, Megan has started to look into volunteering since graduating. The first place Megan has inquired about volunteering is NYCWiC.
						Megan attended NYCWiC twice while she was in school and thought it would be great to help out a conference that had really impacted her. 
						She believes NYCWiC is an incredible opportunity for students and is excited to help this conference prosper. <br><br>
						Currently, Megan is creating a discord server for NYCWiC to increase student engagement. The server would be an ideal place for students to ask questions, 
						share their NYCWiC experience, and post about projects that they are working on while the conference is not in session. Though Megan has just started her work with NYCWiC, 
						she is looking forward to having more opportunities to help increase visibility and support for women in computing.
