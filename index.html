	       <p class="main">
	       My name is Megan, I am 24 years old and I have been an avid gamer since I was approximately 4 years old.
	       I may not be the best at video games but I thoroughly enjoy playing them. I like many more games and genres than
	       just the ones listed on this site. Currently, I only usually have the time to play games 2-3 times a week.
	       The reason for this is that I am working part-time and I'm in college. When I do play games you can
	       usually catch me streaming them on twitch. The degree I am working towards is also related to gaming.
	       My major in college is Informatics with a concentration in Game Design and Development. It has
	       always been a dream of mine to work with video games. I'm hoping when I get out of school to 
	       make games and voice act in my own video games (being a voice actress is also a dream of mine).
	       In the meantime, I just started working at a company that produces labels. They produce labels from
	       start up to corporate companies. It's very interesting work, I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I do.
		   If I am not working, gaming, or studying then I am most likely watching anime or shows with my friends. 
		   Another big thing about me is I'm a huge advocate for mental health. As someone who has struggled with my mental health in the past,
		   it's important to know that there is nothing wrong with struggling with your mental health.
		   If you are reading this and enjoy this site then be sure to contact me 
	       via my email! Please let me know if you would like to see recommendations of more types of games! Thank you all again for visiting my site.
