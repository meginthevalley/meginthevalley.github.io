				This minigame was made for the Wolfjam Hackathon that Megan participated in. The hackathon took place for one day in November of 2023. For this event,
				Megan worked in a team of 6. Megan was tasked with creating one of the minigames, specifically, the spot the difference minigame. The minigame was made in 3D Unity so that it 
				could easily work with the main game and the other minigame. Due to time constraints, this minigame was done in about an hour or two. In the end, the minigame did not make it into the submission
				because they were worried about getting everything in place and submitting on time. Below is a video of the minigame a little before the game was finished. The player is meant to 
				find all the differences and then enter the answer to procede to the next part of the story. All code for this was implemented though it was not demonstrated in this video.

					Below are some videos Megan had thrown together to help students with frequently asked questions and to go over what the students had learned in class so they would not feel 
					lost if they fell behind. These videos are quite lengthy but each one links to Megan's YouTube where she has posted about her projects.

								out the code so rather than write it live on the video, she copy and pasted the code over by bits with the comments so she could then explain the code while 
								students were writing. This helped the students to understand what the code did as they were typing it out and testing it for themselves. The menu goes over

				  <p class="main">This is the first website Megan had created. It was for a class in the Fall of 2021. For this project, Megan had decided to make a brief gaming recommendation website.
					 Megan was a Twitch streamer at the time and has always loved video games so she thought it would be a fun website to make. She tried to keep the color scheme close to the colors for 
					 her Twitch logo. <br><br>
					 There are many things Megan would change about this site if it was made today instead of years ago. One big change would be the videos used in the tabs. On the server 
					 that the website was being posted to there was a size limit that Megan had not realized until last minute and had to quickly make shorter videos. Megan would also add more games, different games, 
					 more game options, a way for users to get to each game without scrolling, and more if it were done today. 
					 <br><br>The video below gives a brief overview of the site. In the future, Megan would love to remake this site with the changes listed above and post it to it's own custom domain.
					  Listed below the video is a link to the site in it's state from 2021 if you would like to visit it and check it out!

					  <h3 class="subHeading1">Piskel</h3>
					  <p class="main">Piskel has been Megan's preferred way to make art when she experiments in her free time. Here is some of Megan's piskel art though not included on this site yet is Megan's 
						bee game which was one of Megan's first games made entirely with her pixel art. This can be found on Megan's itch.io link in her contact page. Currently, Megan has been commissioned to make 
						pixel art for a twitch streamer which will be added after it's completion. Most of the pixel art currently on this page is from Megan's first attempts that she would love to improve in the future.

									<img src="Scary Fairy.png" alt="A pixel pic of a 'Scary Fairy' that Megan made.">
							  <div class="imageDescription"> This was also for a class project and was one of Megan's first pixel attempts. 
								Megan had toyed with the idea of animating this an including it in a cut scene in future projects as a nod to one of her first attempts at pixel art.

								<img src="Mobster Squirrel.gif" alt="A pixel gif of a mobster squirrel that Megan made.">
						  <div class="imageDescription"> This was a "Mobster Squirrel" that Megan created. She really loved the idea of a squirrel shooting accorns and wanted to include it in her bee game but she felt it needed more 
							work before it was ready to be implemented into a game. She did think the catch phrase "Go Nuts" would've been nice and that lead to ideas of a possible squirrel game for the future.
