		 		<p class="main"><i>Cat-astrophe!</i> was made in April of 2023 and it is 
					a VR Game made in Unity (2021.3.17f1). <i>Cat-astrophe!</i> was an independent 
					project that was made for Megan's first class working in Unity.
					For this game, Megan used an older version of unity so she needed 
					to manually create the locomotion system for player movement.
					Megan had created many assets using unity primitives including
					the furniture, the litter box (and everything in it), and the remote. 
					All other small assets came from TurboSquid.

			<p class="main"><i>Hide & Go Squeak!</i> was made in April of 2024 and it is a VR Game made in Unreal Engine 5. <i>Hide & Go Squeak!</i> was a team 
				project that was made for Megan's AR/VR class. Megan did a lot of work in Blueprints for this project and it was her first game made in Unreal. Doing 
				VR for her first Unreal project was certainly a challenge but it was relatively easy for Megan to work with Blueprints. <br><br> Megan was able to add adjustable music and SFX sounds. 
				She also allowed the player to switch between teleportation and continuous movement based on their preferences. Megan had programmed and set up the beginning and end 
				screens for the game as well. As a last thing to add, Megan had coded a clock table that moved along as if hands on the clock were spinning. In the future she would 
				love to code this to set a timer for the player to find the mice by and add a losing condition to the game as well.

							This video is of the screen the player sees when they first enter the game.  During playtesting, players said they were unsure of how to play the game and that is why this screen was added! 
							After this, players were able to understand the objective and controls of the game easily before playing and the developing team got no further playtesting notes from future sessions regarding this issue.<br> <br>
							Due to the quality of the video it is hard to see the text though it is easy for players to read the text while playing the game. There was a timer for the beginning screen that allowed the 
							players enough time to read the instructions before being brought into the game. The teleportation function can also be seen in this video and a brief bit of the main area is seen as well.

							This video is a brief demonstration of the gameplay. First the player decides to go into the settings and adjust the controls and change the volume to their desired levels. 
							After that the player explores the room. They find their first mouse at the clock table where the player can watch the clock move. The player then brings that mouse to the 
							bin and searches for other mice. This loop is repeated until the player has put all the mice in the bin (not shown in this video).<br><br> The player can take their time finding 
							the mice and have fun in the environment since there are no time constraints. After all mice are found the player would be brought to the end screen.
							The end screen consists of a "You Win" text and each mouse on a shelf next to their portrait. The end screen is not seen in this video though it is essentially the same 
							as the intro screen but with different music, shelves, pictures, and different text. In future versions of the game, the development team would like to add timed modes, more levels, 
							and more hiding spots.

				<h3 class="subHeading1">Gaming Recommendation Site</h3>
				  
				<!-- Description of the site -->
				<p class="main">This is the first website Megan had created. It was for a class in the Fall of 2021. For this project, Megan had decided to make a brief gaming recommendation website.
					Megan was a Twitch streamer at the time and has always loved video games so she thought it would be a fun website to make. She tried to keep the color scheme close to the colors for 
					her Twitch logo. <br><br> There are many things Megan would change about this site if it was made today instead of years ago. One big change would be the videos used in the tabs. On the server 
					that the website was being posted to there was a size limit that Megan had not realized until last minute and had to quickly make shorter videos. Megan would also add more games, different games, 
					more game options, a way for users to get to each game without scrolling, and more if it were done today. <br><br>The video below gives a brief overview of the site. In the future, Megan would 
					love to remake this site with the changes listed above and post it to it's own custom domain. Listed below the video is a link to the site in it's state from 2021 if you would like to visit 
					it and check it out!

				<p class="main">This is the site you are on right now! Megan coded this site entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. She started off with the Gaming Recommendation Site she had

					The version of the site you see here is it's FIRST completed form. You may notice updates that are not posted in this gallery. That means that these updates 
					likely came after July 2024. For any major updates to the site Megan will be sure to add a picture or video to the gallery showing the update and saying when it was completed.
