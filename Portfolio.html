			simulator where the player would serve the customers and try to pour the right amount to
			receive a better review. At the end of the game the review is calculated and if you receive 
			more than 3 stars, you get to keep your job. For this game, Megan used an older version of Unity 
			so she used <br> the locomotion system she had created previously in <i>Cat-astrophe!</i> for player movement.
			Megan had created all of the assets for <i>Wine-Time</i> except for the glasses (from TurboSquid) and the music 
			(from the Unity assets Store).</p>
