	   				<p class="about"> Hello everyone! My name is Megan LaValley. Currently, I am 27 years old and I am an
						aspiring game programmer. I have always been extremely passionate about video games and what better way to 
						show my passion than by making games! As soon as I was taught programming I knew that it was the right place for me.<br> <br>
						I recently graduated from UAlbany obtaining a Bachelor's in Informatics with a concentration in Game Design & Development.
						Since graduating in May 2024, I have been spending time researching for future projects, starting Udemy courses to expand my coding knowledge,
						making this website, and creating a discord for NYCWiC (New York Women in Computing). 
		 				I plan on volunteering with them for their conference in 2025 and I am very excited for the opportunity
		 				to give back to a conference that helped me throughout my college journey.<br><br>

		 				As for a career, I would love to work in the game development industry. I am passionate about coding and can adapt to new coding languages 
		 				with little to no issues. I currently live in South Glens Falls but I am looking to relocate to the Albany area (both in NY). 
		 				For professional inquiries, please contact me through email or LinkedIn.
